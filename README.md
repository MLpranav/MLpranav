## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav - a quantitative developer/researcher and machine learning enthusiast with extensive experience in development of algorithmic trading systems, idea validation and portfolio/strategy level optimisation.

I've been working at the intersection of technology and financial markets for ~4 years and my experience spans across various markets and asset classes including commodities, cryptocurrencies, equities and options.

When not coding :computer:, I play Chess :chess_pawn:, read :books:, swim :swimming_man: and travel :airplane:.

I'm always open to feedback and collaboration. You can reach me [:speech_balloon: here](mailto:pranavmittal.ml@gmail.com).

See you around!
