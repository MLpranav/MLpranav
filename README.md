## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav - a software developer, finance geek and *upcoming* machine learning engineer.

I am documenting my machine learning (and overall tech) journey across [my blog](https://mlpranav.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/MLpranav) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MLpranav).

Hopefully my content can help flatten the learning curve for other developers and ML enthusiasts.

When not coding :computer:, I play Chess :chess_pawn:, read :books:, swim :swimming_man: and travel :helicopter:.

#### Milestones:

- [x] 31st March 2023 - Started learning ML and documenting my journey.

I'm always open to feedback and collaboration. You can reach me [here](mailto:pranavmittal.ml@gmail.com).

See you around!
