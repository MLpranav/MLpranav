## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pranav - a software developer, finance geek and *upcoming* machine learning engineer.

I have more than 3 years of experience in developing performant web apps and algorithmic trading systems.

I am documenting my machine learning and tech journey across [my blog](https://mlpranav.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/MLpranav) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MLpranav).

I hope that my content can help flatten the learning curve for other developers and ML enthusiasts.
